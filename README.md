<h1>Auction Mobile App</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Auction Mobile App is a personal project that I am currently creating with the intent of publishing. The application enables verified users to list a request and others to respond with details of an offer. The lister can view these offers and the details of the users before managing and closing the request. The main goal of this project for myself is to advance my skills in mobile development by implementing the best practices of React Native and version control. I also hope to gain more experience in application deployment with the goal of publishing on the app store.</p>
